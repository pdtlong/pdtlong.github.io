**This is my completed project about POS Tagging** __*Achieved over 95% accuracy*__

**Part-of-Speech** (POS) *(noun, verb, and preposition)* can help in understanding the meaning of a text by identifying how different words are used in a sentence. POS can reveal a lot of information about neighbouring words and syntactic structure of a sentence.

**The Hidden Markov Models (HMM)** is a statistical model for modelling generative sequences characterized by an underlying process generating an observable sequence.

*POS tagging using Hidden Markov Models (HMMs)* which are *probabilistic sequence models*.

### [NLP] Building a Transition Based Dependency Parsing

**Transition-based dependency parsing**: is a fast and effective approach for dependency parsing. Traditionally, a transitionbased dependency parser processes an input sentence and predicts a sequence of parsing actions in a left-to-right manner.

Successfully built a complete model with detailed running steps. You can refer to the details in the code section, Model currently has 45 Postags, 94084 tokens and total 349 dependency arcs

### [NLP] Evaluation of the quality of word embedding models for Vietnamese (GloVe, Word2Vec, ELMO, FASTTEXT)

**This is a research project that got a highest score in my and a friend's natural language processing course on evaluating the quality of Word embeddings models for Vietnamese.**

The main task focuses on **evaluating the quality of Words Embedding models** Including: **GloVe, Word2Vec, ELMO, FASTTEXT**

To ensure fairness for the evaluation process. The model will be passed 2 criteria: 
- **Accuracy scores**
- **Convergence speed when training through loss**

In addition, the evaluation process also takes place on **4 different models:**

### [NLP] Deep Text Abtractive Summarization of Vietnamese news using GAN

[![View on GitHub](https://img.shields.io/badge/GitHub-View_on_GitHub-blue?logo=GitHub)](https://github.com/pdtlong/Text-Abtractive-Summarization-Using-GAN)

**Abstractive Text Summarization**: is the task of generating a short and concise summary that captures the salient ideas of the source text. The generated summaries potentially contain new phrases and sentences that may not appear in the source text

Within the scope of this project, I do it on *crawled data from Vietnamese news stories and label them as empty news* (the news has been summarized by the station).
